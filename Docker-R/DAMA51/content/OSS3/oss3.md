# **Comprehensive Guide to Machine Learning Topics**

---

## **1. Predictive Modeling**
Predictive modeling is used to analyze historical data and make future predictions.

### **1.1 Regression**
Regression is used when the output variable is continuous.
#### **Types of Regression**
- **Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between variables with a straight line.
  - Example: Predicting house prices based on size.
  - Formula:  
    \\[
    y = mx + b
    \\]
  - Where:
    - \\( y \\) = dependent variable (output)
    - \\( x \\) = independent variable (input)
    - \\( m \\) = slope of the line
    - \\( b \\) = intercept
- **Polynomial Regression**: Models curved relationships.
- **Ridge & Lasso Regression**: Add penalties to prevent overfitting.

#### **Use Cases**
- Predicting sales revenue.
- Forecasting stock prices.

---

### **1.2 Classification**
Classification is used when the output variable belongs to predefined categories.
#### **Types of Classification Algorithms**
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification (e.g., spam vs. non-spam).
- **Decision Trees & Random Forests**: Used for complex decision-making.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Neural Networks**: Used in deep learning.

#### **Use Cases**
- Medical diagnosis (disease vs. no disease).
- Email spam filtering.

---

### **1.3 Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning**
- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds hidden patterns without predefined labels.

---

## **2. Measuring Similarity & Distance**
### **2.1 Similarity Measures**
- **Cosine Similarity**: Used in text processing.
  - Example: Comparing two documents to see if they discuss the same topic.
- **Jaccard Similarity**: Used to compare two sets.
  - Example: Recommending similar products based on past purchases.

### **2.2 Distance Measures**
- **Euclidean Distance**: The straight-line distance between two points.
- **Manhattan Distance**: Measures distance in a grid-like pattern.
- **Minkowski Distance**: Generalizes both Euclidean and Manhattan distances.
- **Hamming Distance**: Used for text or binary data (e.g., DNA sequences).

---

## **3. Clustering Algorithms**
Clustering groups data points that share similar characteristics.

### **3.1 Hierarchical Clustering**
- **Agglomerative**: Starts with individual points and merges them.
- **Divisive**: Starts with one large cluster and splits it.

### **3.2 Linkage Methods**
- **Single Linkage**: Uses the closest point in each cluster.
- **Complete Linkage**: Uses the farthest point.
- **Centroid Linkage**: Uses the cluster center.

---

## **4. K-Means Clustering**
A widely used clustering method that partitions data into ‚ÄúK‚Äù groups.

### **4.1 Steps in K-Means**
1. Choose the number of clusters \\( K \\).
2. Randomly initialize \\( K \\) centroids.
3. Assign each point to the nearest centroid.
4. Recalculate centroids.
5. Repeat until the centroids no longer change.

### **4.2 Choosing the Right K**
- **Elbow Method**: Plots variance against \\( K \\) to find the optimal number of clusters.

---

## **5. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
A clustering method that assumes data is generated from multiple Gaussian distributions.

### **5.1 Soft Clustering**
- **Hard Clustering (K-Means)**: Each data point belongs to one cluster.
- **Soft Clustering (GMM)**: Each data point has probabilities of belonging to multiple clusters.

### **5.2 Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm**
1. **Expectation Step (E-Step)**: Assigns probabilities for each point.
2. **Maximization Step (M-Step)**: Updates parameters.

---

## **6. Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN)**
A clustering method that identifies dense clusters and outliers.

### **6.1 Advantages**
- No need to specify the number of clusters.
- Works well with irregularly shaped clusters.
- Identifies noise points.

### **6.2 Key Concepts**
- **Core Points**: Have enough neighbors to form a cluster.
- **Border Points**: Fall within a core point‚Äôs neighborhood but don‚Äôt have enough neighbors.
- **Noise Points**: Are not part of any cluster.

---

## **7. Association Rule Learning**
Finds relationships between items in large datasets.

### **7.1 Concepts**
- **Support**: Frequency of an itemset.
- **Confidence**: Probability that item \\( Y \\) is bought given \\( X \\) is bought.
- **Lift**: Measures the strength of a rule.

### **7.2 Apriori Algorithm**
1. Finds frequent item sets.
2. Generates association rules.
3. Uses **anti-monotone property**: If an itemset is infrequent, all its supersets are also infrequent.

#### **Example**
- "People who buy milk and bread are likely to buy butter."

---

## **8. Dimensionality Reduction**
Reduces the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information.

### **8.1 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Projects high-dimensional data onto fewer dimensions.
- Keeps as much variance as possible.

### **8.2 t-SNE**
- A non-linear technique for visualizing high-dimensional data.
